# Teensy eurorack experiments

An evolution of electronic audio experiments involving firmware, circuits, pcbs &amp; panels for teensy 3.6 micro-controllers. 

**Strictly speaking, its not eurorack, yet!** Eventually, I will interface with CV and trigger/gate. And currently the audio jacks are 1/4" stereo TRS jacks! 

Ideally, I'd like to create a low-cost gereric, programmable do-it-yourself modular audio component.
